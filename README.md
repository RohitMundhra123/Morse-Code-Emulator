# Morse Code Emulator using Arduino

This project is a Morse Code Emulator using an Arduino, push button, and seven segment display. It was designed and tested using Tinkercad.

## Project Components

- `.ino` file: This file contains the code for the Arduino.
- `.brd` file: This is the electrical design file for the circuit.
- `.pdf` file: This file contains the circuit design.
- `.csv` file: This file contains the list of components used in the project.

## How to Use

1. Upload the `.ino` file to the Arduino.
2. Connect the push button and seven segment display according to the circuit diagram.
3. Power on the Arduino.
4. Press the push button to input Morse code.
5. The seven segment display will output the corresponding letter.

## Notes

- The Morse code input is limited to letters A-Z and numbers 0-9.
- The project was designed and tested using Tinkercad, but can be replicated using physical components.
- The code can be modified to customize the Morse code input or output.
